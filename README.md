## General info

This project outlines the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services to deploy an application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The pipeline makes use of AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline.

## Overview
AWS CodeCommit is chosen to store the  source code, AWS CodeBuild for building artifacts, AWS CodeDeploy for deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and AWS CodePipeline to orchestrate the entire CI/CD workflow.

## Services
 - **AWS CodeCommit**: Used as the source code repository
 - **AWS CodeBuild**: Build service for creating artifacts
 - **AWS S3**: Storage for the build artifacts
 - **AWS CodeDeploy**: Deployment service to deploy artifacts to various targets
 - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Hosting environment for the application.
 - **AWS RDS**: MySQL database instance connected to the Beanstalk environment.

## Workflow

  - **Code Commit**: Developers commit changes to the AWS CodeCommit repository.
  - **CodeBuild**: CodeBuild is used to build artifacts. Multiple CodeBuild projects can be set up for various tasks like code analysis, build, and unit testing.
  - **S3 Bucket**: The artifacts generated by CodeBuild are stored in an S3 bucket.
  - **CodeDeploy**: AWS CodeDeploy takes the artifacts and deploys them to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.
  - **Elastic Beanstalk**: The Elastic Beanstalk environment is running a Tomcat platform and is connected to an AWS RDS MySQL database.
  - **Code Pipeline**: AWS CodePipeline orchestrates the entire process, ensuring a smooth and automated flow from code change to application deployment.
